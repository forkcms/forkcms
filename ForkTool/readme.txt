This needs to be installed via terminal.

To install this, copy this folder to /usr/lib/php (if you cannot see it in finder, type: defaults write.com.apple AppleShowAllFiles TRUE)

Now in terminal type: alias ft=/usr/lib/php/ForkTool/ft.sh

To use this (currently you can only create modules) type:

ft module modulename

Let me explain this, ft stands for Fork Tool (the alias you just created)
module stands for the fact of what you want to create, and modulename is the name of the module, obvious.
