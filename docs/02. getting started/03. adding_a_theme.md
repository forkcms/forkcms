# Adding a theme

Your website needs a design that sets the right tone. In the [extensions](http://www.fork-cms.com/extensions/themes) page you'll find an overview of available themes that are ready to be used within Fork CMS. Choose a design that fits best with your content.

Download the desired theme and upload it with the *Upload theme* button in the Settings > Themes section.

Select the uploaded theme and don't forget to click *save* afterwards.

In every theme there are templates available for different kind of pages. Templates represent the layout or structure of the page. If you're familiar with HTML you can [create your own templates](../04.%20theming-guide/06.%20creating_a_template.md) without the need for an entirely new design.

You can also build completely customized website designs in Fork CMS. Take a look at our [Theme Guide](../04.%20theming%20guide/01.%20introduction.md) to start transforming your design into a custom theme.
