# Introduction

The Media library is a module that allows you to put all your image/files/movies/audio files in it. These files can then easily be connected to entities from custom modules. There are also widgets to show these files as you like, f.e.: slider, lightbox, listing, ... and you can easily create your own type of widget (in your own custom module).


## LiipImagineBundle

The media library module uses the [Liip Imagine Bundle](http://symfony.com/doc/1.0/bundles/LiipImagineBundle/index.html) to serve the images.

The media library in fork comes with 5 predefined filters. For more information about how to configure filters you can check the [official Liip Imagine Bundle documentation](http://symfony.com/doc/1.0/bundles/LiipImagineBundle/filters.html).

The 5 predefined filters can be found in `app/config/config.yml`, [view config.yml here](app/config/config.yml).

If you want to add your own filters you can append them to the config.

## Database

We have chosen to have a tight-coupled connection between your "custom entity" and the "MediaGroup". The MediaGroup entity holds all the connected media items.
