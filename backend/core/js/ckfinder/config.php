 *
 * In a generic usage case, the following tasks must be done to configure
 * CKFinder:
 *     1. Check the $baseUrl and $baseDir variables;
 *     2. If available, paste your license key in the "LicenseKey" setting;
 *     3. Create the CheckAuthentication() function that enables CKFinder for authenticated users;
 *
 * Other settings may be left with their default values, or used to control
 * advanced features of CKFinder.

 Due to security issues with Apache modules, it is recommended to leave the

	  uploaded.
	- If "rar" (or any other) extension is allowed, one can upload a file named
	  foo.rar.
	- The file foo.php.rar has "rar" extension so, in theory, it can be also
	  uploaded.

In some conditions Apache can treat the foo.php.rar file just like any PHP
script and execute it.

If CheckDoubleExtension is enabled, each part of the file name after a dot is
checked, not only the last part. In this way, uploading foo.php.rar would be
denied, because "php" is on the denied extensions list.
