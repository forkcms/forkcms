      Creating a place on your website where visitors find their answers fast and accurate, not always an easy task. The FAQ modules gives you a head start.
      This module allows you to collect the questions you answer into categories creating a clear and easy to browse overview of knowledge. We present the most read questions beside this, creating a very quick answer to most frequently asked questions.
      We've created separated pages for every Q&A. Doing so we can easily implement four extra features within this module:
      * Go deep into the answer: you have the place to explain through text and images what your costumers want to know.
      * Answer related questions: based on the categories the FAQ modules offers the user a range of related questions, so bringing him/her closer to what they're looking for.
      * Improve you documentation: underneath the answer you find a form for feedback. Who didn't find what they were looking for is given the possibility to relief his or her grieves.
      * Contact us: Found no answer at all? We link the FAQ module to your contactpage so every question gets answered.
      * Display questions from a FAQ category on a selected page
