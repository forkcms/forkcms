<h3>1. Definitions</h3>

<p>&ldquo;Agreement Name&rdquo; shall mean the name used to reference this Agreement in any context, which

<p>&ldquo;Software&rdquo; or &ldquo;CKFinder&rdquo; shall mean the copyrighted material owned by CKSource,
	subject to the terms of this License. The Software is publicly, uniquely, and in its entirety recognizable
	by the &ldquo;CKFinder&rdquo; name (&ldquo;Software Name&rdquo;).</p>

<p>&ldquo;Software Release&rdquo; or &ldquo;Release&rdquo; shall mean a set of files distributed by CKSource, or
	anyone authorized to distribute it, that represents the Software. A Release is uniquely identified by the

	combination of both.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Release Date&rdquo; shall mean the day that CKSource started distributing a Release.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Product&rdquo; shall mean a single computer program or one or more websites (&ldquo;Program&rdquo;)
	(i) owned by You, or (ii) to which the owner grants You the permission to act in behalf of the owner for the
	purposes of this Agreement. A Program family or a group of Programs does not constitute a Product for the
	scope of this Agreement. A Program that goes in competition with the Software in the marketplace does not
	constitute a valid Product for the scope of this Agreement.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Development Server&rdquo; shall mean a computer with one or more computer central processing units
	(CPU&rsquo;s) that operates for the exclusive purpose of software development or software testing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Development Activity&rdquo; shall mean the act of interacting with the Software or one of its

<p>&ldquo;Developer&rdquo; shall mean an authorized person designated by You to perform Development
	Activities.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Production Website&rdquo; shall mean a Product with the Software installed, which already had
	Development Activities performed, and that has been delivered to end-users for production usage. Maintenance
	activities performed on Production Websites, excluding software development activities related to the
	Software, are not considered Development Activities.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hostname&rdquo; shall mean a unique name by which a website is reachable in a network. This includes,
	but is not limited to, a website IP address. (For example, if a website is reachable by the Internet
	address &ldquo;<a href="http://www.example.com/">http://www.example.com/</a>&rdquo;, the Hostname
	is &ldquo;<a href="http://www.example.com/">www.example.com</a>&rdquo;.)</p>

<p>&ldquo;Legal Entity&rdquo; shall mean the union of the acting entity and all other entities that control, are
	controlled by, or are under common control of that entity. For the purposes of this definition, &quot;control&quot;

<p>&ldquo;Effective Date&rdquo; means the date on which the Legal Evidence is made effective.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rdquo; (or &ldquo;Your&rdquo;) shall mean an individual or a Legal Entity exercising permissions

<h3>2. Grant of License</h3>

<p>Subject to the terms of this Agreement, CKSource hereby grants You, in one of the License Models described in
	Section 4, a non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty free, worldwide license (&ldquo;License&rdquo;)
	to use, reproduce, modify, and distribute a Software Release in a collective work assembled with the
	Product.</p>

<p>You should carefully read the following terms and conditions before using, installing, copying, or
	distributing the Software. Unless otherwise agreed in writing by CKSource, your use, installation, copying,
	or distribution of the Software indicates your acceptance of this License.</p>

<h3>3. Scope of License</h3>

<p>All rights of any kind to the Software, which are not expressly granted in this Agreement, are entirely and
	exclusively reserved to and by CKSource. The Software is protected by applicable national and international
	laws and treaties.</p>

<p>You may use, install, copy, and distribute the Software solely as provided in this Agreement. You may not
	rent, lease, loan, sublicense, reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, or create derivative works based on
	the Software, in whole or in part, nor permit anyone else to do so.</p>

<p>It is agreed that in exchange for the license set forth herein, you will pay a license fee (&ldquo;License
	Fee&rdquo;). The fee value will be specified by CKSource at the moment of the purchase.</p>

<h3>4. License Models</h3>

<p>The Software may be assembled with the Product and redistributed in respect of one, and only one, of the
	following models (&ldquo;License Models&rdquo;) of Your choice:</p>

<ul>
	<li>a)&nbsp;(&ldquo;Basic&rdquo;) Assembling the Software into a Product distributed as a single website (&ldquo;Site&rdquo;).
		The Site URL (&ldquo;URL&rdquo;) must be specified at the moment of purchase. The license will not be
		valid for sub-domains of the specified URL. This license includes 2 Developer licenses that cover
		Development Activities exclusively related to the Site.
	</li>
	<li>b)&nbsp;(&ldquo;Professional&rdquo;) Assembling the Software with a maximum of 3 websites (&ldquo;Professional
		Sites&rdquo;) owned or produced by You. Sites produced by third-parties with Software produced by You
		are not included in this License Model. This license includes 5 Developer licenses that cover
		Development Activities exclusively related to Professional Sites.
	</li>
	<li>c)&nbsp;(&ldquo;Developer&rdquo;) License granting Development Activities to a single Developer
		Person.
	</li>
</ul>

<p>A valid Developer license is required for every single Developer Person. Developer licenses cannot be shared
	among different Developer Persons. Non-Development Activities on Production Websites do not require
	Developer licenses.</p>

<p>License Fee values may differ depending on the license model.</p>

<h3>5. Unlicensed Copies</h3>

<p>If You did not pay License Fee, You may use unlicensed copies of CKFinder for the exclusive purpose of
	demonstration. In this case You will be using CKFinder in &quot;demo mode&quot;. Without derogating from the
	forgoing, You may not use CKFinder in &quot;demo mode&quot; for commercial purposes. CKFinder shall only be
	used for evaluation purposes and may not be used or disclosed for any other purposes, including, without
	limitation, for external distribution. You may not remove the demo notices from the interface nor disable
	the ability to display such notices or otherwise modify CKFinder. Product support, if any, is not offered
	for CKFinder in &quot;demo mode&quot;.</p>

<h3>6. Agreement Acceptance</h3>

<p>This Agreement is automatically accepted by both parties as long as You are in possession of legal evidence (&ldquo;Legal
	Evidence&rdquo;) that the acceptance has taken place. The Legal Evidence can be represented by (i) a copy of
	this Agreement signed by You and CKSource or (ii) a valid Certificate of License Ownership, provided by
	CKSource and addressed to You. The Legal Evidence must precisely indicate this Agreement Name, the Software
	Name, the License Model You have chosen, and the following restrictive information, if applicable:</p>

<ul>
	<li>a)&nbsp;If You have chosen the Basic License Model, the Site Hostname must be indicated in the Legal
		Evidence. This Agreement will be valid for the Software assembled with the Site publicized under the
		Site Hostname only. Other Sites are excluded from this Agreement as long as a Legal Evidence is not
		produced for each of these Sites.
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Legal Evidences for different combinations of License Models, Sites, and Products will not restrict each
	other and will not interfere in the rights granted to You by each of them.</p>

<p>Legal Evidences are not transferable to different Sites and Products.</p>

<h3>7. Limitation on Releases</h3>

<p>This agreement is valid for all Releases of the Software with Release Dates within or before the 365 days
	that follow the Effective Date (&ldquo;Upgrade Period&rdquo;). CKSource has no obligation to provide you any
	Release that is not released for general distribution to other CKSource licensees. Nothing in this Agreement
	shall be construed to obligate CKSource to provide additional Releases to You under any circumstances.</p>

<h3>8. Support</h3>

<p>CKSource shall provide support for Developers covered by valid Developer licenses for the period of 365 days
	following the Effective Date (&ldquo;Support Period&rdquo;). Support shall be limited to electronic
	messaging access. CKSource shall keep You informed, either per CKSource readiness or by following your
	request, including changes to it, about the rules and procedures that You must perform to enjoy support
	under the terms of this Agreement. Support topics shall be limited to the following (each a &ldquo;Support
	Request&rdquo;):</p>

<ul>
	<li>a)&nbsp;problem solving,</li>
	<li>b)&nbsp;bug reporting,</li>
	<li>c)&nbsp;and documentation clarification.</li>
</ul>

<p>The number of Support Requests that CKSource is entitled to accept from You is limited to 2 per month if You
	have chosen the Basic license model, or 5 per month if You have chosen the Professional license model.
	CKSource may refuse Support Requests that exceed these limits.</p>

<p>CKSource is not in any way obliged to perform bug fixing or custom development activities as a result of a
	Support Request.</p>

<h3>9. License Key</h3>

<p>Following a valid License purchase, a unique license key (the &quot;License Key&quot;) may be provided to
	You, which allows Software activation. The License Key is subject to the restrictions set forth in this
	License and may not be disclosed or distributed in any way. The disclosure or distribution of the License
	Key shall constitute a breach of this License, the effect of which shall be the automatic termination and
	revocation of any and all rights granted herein.</p>

<h3>10. Source Code</h3>

<p>The original source code (&quot;Source Code&quot;) of the Software may be distributed by CKSource alongside
	its executable version, or as an integral part of it. You may modify and compile the Source Code. The Source
	Code or its modified version can be copied and distributed exclusively within the scope of this license, as
	defined in the &quot;License Model&quot; terms of this license, as long as a valid license has been
	purchased for the distribution target. CKSource retains all rights over the Source Code and all its modified
	versions. Redistributions of the Source Code and modified versions of it must contain the original headers
	and copyright notices. Modifications to the Source Code must be explicitly and entirely identified in the
	Source Code files. This section of the license supersedes all modification restrictions imposed by other
	sections. You are not allowed to remove copyright notices nor make changes to the license validation code
	present in the Source Code.</p>

<h3>11. License Fee</h3>

<p>In consideration for the License granted in this Agreement during the term of this Agreement, You agreed to
	pay to CKSource a one time fee (&ldquo;License Fee&rdquo;).</p>

<p>In consideration for the Software upgrades access and support services provided during the Upgrade Period and
	Support Period, You shall pay a yearly fee (&ldquo;Annual Support and Upgrade Fee&rdquo;).</p>

<p>The License Fee and the Annual Support and Upgrade Fee amount shall be specified by CKSource at the moment of
	the purchase as a single unified price.</p>

<p>The fees listed in this Agreement do not include taxes. If CKSource is required to pay any sales, use,
	property, excise, value added, gross receipts, withholding or other taxes levied on the Software or support
	under this Agreement or on Your use thereof, then such taxes shall be billed to and paid by You. This
	Section does not apply to taxes based on CKSource net income, franchise taxes or CKSource&rsquo;s employer
	contributions and taxes.</p>

<p>You understand that CKSource uses third-party paying agents to process selected payments. You understand that
	until payments are not received and verified by the paying agent, this Agreement is not valid.</p>

<p>All payments made hereunder are nonrefundable. You may not withhold or set off any amounts due under this
	Agreement. Failure to pay any fee when due shall constitute a material breach of this Agreement. In
	addition, if You fail to make any payments when due for support, upon written notice to You, CKSource shall
	cease providing support.</p>

<h3>12. Automatic Renewal</h3>

<p>You may opt to automatically extend the expiration date for both the Upgrade Period and Support Period by
	successive cycles of 365 days (each one a &ldquo;Renewal&rdquo;). In such case, you agree to pay a fee for
	each Renewal at the beginning of each cycle. The annual Renewal fee shall be informed by CKSource at the
	moment of the purchase and optionally agreed by you.</p>

<p>If you opted to have automatic Renewals, CKSource shall send you a payment request for the Renewal fee at any
	moment following the first day of each Renewal period. You shall perform the full payment in 30 calendar
	days following the payment request.</p>

<p>Both parties can discontinue the automatic Renewals by written notification to the other party before the
	beginning of extension cycles.</p>

<h3>13. Reservation of Rights and Ownership</h3>

	copyright and other intellectual property laws and treaties. CKSource owns the title, copyright, and other
	intellectual property rights in the Software. The Software is licensed, not sold. This Agreement does not
	grant you any rights to the Software&#39;s trademarks or services.</p>

<h3>14. Termination</h3>

<p>Without prejudice to any other rights, this Agreement automatically terminates if You fail to comply with the
	terms and conditions of this Agreement. You may terminate this Agreement at any time without cause. In case
	of termination, in any circumstance, payments issued by You will not be reimbursed.</p>

<p>You shall immediately discontinue distribution of Product, assembled with the Software, upon expiration or
	termination of this Agreement.</p>

<h3>15. Warranty</h3>
