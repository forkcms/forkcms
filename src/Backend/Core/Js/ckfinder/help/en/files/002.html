		CKFinder Interface Overview</h1>
	<p>
		The CKFinder interface is designed to be clean, familiar to end users, and easy to
		learn and use. Most features can be handled with a mouse click as well as by using
		the context menus.</p>
	<p>
		If you are familiar with desktop file browsers built in most operating systems
		available for your PC or laptop, you will quickly see that using an online file
		manager is just as easy and intuitive.</p>
	<p>
		The following is a screenshot of the CKFinder interface:</p>
