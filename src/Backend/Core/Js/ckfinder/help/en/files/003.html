	<h1>
		Folders Pane</h1>
	<p>
		The <strong>Folders Pane</strong> contains the "tree view" of the folders that you can navigate.
		Folders are used to organize and categorize your files.</p>
	<p style="text-align: center">
		<img src="../../files/images/CKFinder_folder_pane.png" width="176" height="140" alt="CKFinder Folders Pane" />&nbsp;</p>
	<p>
		Folders display is called "tree view" because the folders hierarchy is represented like
		tree branches, with subfolders placed below and indented with regard to their parent items.
		The <strong>Folders Pane</strong> uses the same graphic representation that can be found
		in many modern operating systems.</p>
	<h2>
		Basic Operations</h2>
	<h3>
		Opening (Expanding) a Folder</h3>
	<p>
		In order to open a folder and expand its subfolders, click the plus icon
		(<img src="../../files/images/002.gif" height="9" width="9" alt="" />) in front of the folder name. If the plus
		icon is not present, the folder does not contain any subfolders.</p>
	<p style="text-align: center">
		<img src="../../files/images/CKFinder_folder_expand.png" width="110" height="19" alt="Collapsed CKFinder folder" />&nbsp;</p>
	<p>
		See the "On Request Loading" section below if you require more information about the loading
		process in CKFinder.</p>
	<h3>
		Closing (Collapsing) a Folder</h3>
	<p>
		In order to close a folder and hide (collapse) its subfolders, click the minus icon
		(<img src="../../files/images/003.gif" height="9" width="9" alt="" />) in front of the folder name.</p>
	<p style="text-align: center">
		<img src="../../files/images/CKFinder_folder_collapse.png" width="110" height="50" alt="Expanded CKFinder folder with its subfolders" />&nbsp;</p>
	<h3>
		Selecting a Folder</h3>
	<p>
		In order to select a folder and make it the "current folder" in CKFinder, click the folder
		name or its icon. The selected folder will be highlighted with a different background
		color.</p>
	<p style="text-align: center">
		<img src="../../files/images/CKFinder_folder_select.png" width="162" height="99" alt="Selected CKFinder folder" />&nbsp;</p>
	<h2>
		Advanced Operations</h2>
	<p>
		Advanced operations can be performed on a folder by using its <strong><a href="012.html">Context
		Menu</a></strong>. Depending on the circumstances, the following options may be available:</p>
	<p style="text-align: center">
		<img src="../../files/images/CKFinder_folder_menu.png" width="148" height="128" alt="Folder context menu" />&nbsp;</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>New Subfolder</strong> &ndash; creates a new subfolder in this parent folder.</li>
		<li><strong>Rename</strong> &ndash; changes the name of the folder.</li>
		<li><strong>Copy Files from Basket</strong> &ndash; copies the files that were placed in the
			<strong>Basket</strong> to the selected folder.</li>
		<li><strong>Move Files from Basket</strong> &ndash; moves the files that were placed in the
			<strong>Basket</strong> to the selected folder.</li>
		<li><strong>Delete</strong> &ndash; permanently removes the folder.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		<span class="info">Note:</span> Some context menu options may be disabled (and thus
		grayed out), depending on CKFinder settings enforced by your system administrator.</p>
	<h3>
		Creating Folders</h3>
	<p>
		In order to create a child folder inside an existing folder, choose the
		<strong>New Subfolder</strong> option from the context menu of the parent folder.
		Type the name of the new folder in the dialog window that will be displayed. Once
		you give the new folder a name and close the dialog window, the folder will
		be created.</p>
	<p style="text-align: center">
		<img src="../../files/images/CKFinder_folder_new.png" width="304" height="149" alt="Creating a new folder in CKFinder" />&nbsp;</p>
	<p>
		Not all characters can be used in folder and file names due to limitations of the
		systems where CKFinder runs. Among the characters that cannot be used in folders and
		files names are: <code>\</code> <code>/</code> <code>:</code>
		<code>*</code> <code>?</code> <code>&quot;</code> <code>&lt;</code>
		<code>&gt;</code> and <code>|</code>.</p>
	<h3>
		Renaming Folders</h3>
	<p>
		In order to rename a folder, choose the <strong>Rename</strong> option from its context menu
		or use the <em>F2</em> keyboard shortcut. Type the new folder name in the dialog window that
		will be displayed, overwriting the existing name. Once you enter the new folder name and
		close the dialog window, the folder will be renamed.</p>
	<p style="text-align: center">
		<img src="../../files/images/CKFinder_folder_rename.png" width="304" height="149" alt="Renaming a folder in CKFinder" />&nbsp;</p>
	<p>
		As stated above, not all characters can be used in folder and file names due to limitations of the
		systems where CKFinder runs. Among the characters that cannot be used in folders and
		files names are: <code>\</code> <code>/</code> <code>:</code>
		<code>*</code> <code>?</code> <code>&quot;</code> <code>&lt;</code>
		<code>&gt;</code> and <code>|</code>.</p>
	<p>
		<span class="warning">Attention:</span> When you rename a folder, links or media insertions
		available on other pages and pointing to files or folders inside the renamed folder
		will be broken, and thus not available anymore. Because of that be careful when using this
		feature.</p>
	<h3>
		Copying and Moving Files from Basket</h3>
	<p>
		The <strong>Basket</strong> is a virtual placeholder that can be
		helpful if you want to perform batch operations on files. The copying and moving
		operations are described in the <strong><a href="014.html">"Basket"</a></strong> section
		of the User's Guide.</p>
	<h3>
		Deleting Folders</h3>
	<p>
		In order to delete a folder, including all its contents, choose the <strong>Delete</strong>
		option from its context menu or use the <em>Del</em> key. A confirmation message will appear
		to ensure that this operation is what you really intend to do. Once you confirm the deletion,
		the folder will be removed.</p>
	<p>
		<span class="warning">Attention:</span> This operation cannot be undone. Once you delete the
		folder and its contents, you will not be able to restore the removed files.</p>
	<p style="text-align: center">
		<img src="../../files/images/CKFinder_folder_delete.png" width="304" height="149" alt="Deleting a folder in CKFinder" />&nbsp;</p>
	<p>
		<span class="warning">Attention:</span> When you delete a folder, links or media insertions
		available on other pages and pointing to files or folders inside the deleted folder
		will be broken, and thus not available anymore. Because of that be careful when using this
		feature.</p>
	<h2>
		"On Request" Loading</h2>
	<p>
		The most important difference between CKFinder and the folders tree structures found in
		desktop operating systems is that in CKFinder the folders are loaded "on request". It means
		that the application does not load the entire folders tree structure at startup, but instead
		loads its small subset when the folder is being expanded. This feature is present in
		most advanced web applications like CKFinder and allows to save on bandwidth and loading time.</p>
	<p>
		To indicate that folders are being loaded, the <strong>Loading...</strong> label may appear when
		you expand a folder:</p>
	<p style="text-align: center">
		<img src="../../files/images/CKFinder_folder_loading.png" width="143" height="113" alt="Folder loading in CKFinder" />&nbsp;</p>
	<p>
		The label will automatically disappear once all requested folders are loaded.</p>
