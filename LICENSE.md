Each Licensee may provide Netlash the Derivative Works it has made. The Derivative Works will be subject to a quality control executed by Netlash or a commission established by the latter. Further to this control, Netlash, or said commission, will decide at their own discretion, whether or not it accepts the Derivative Works to be included in the Software. Netlash or said commission will inform the Licensee about this decision. The Licensee explicitly agrees with the further distribution of its contributions as included in the Software, in accordance with these Licence Terms and Conditions. Licensee is then considered a Contributor.

With respect to its contributions to the Software, the Contributor represents that the physical person - author of the contributions, will not invoke his moral rights e.g. his moral right of paternity or his right to oppose modifications to the Software. In the event of infringements on the Software, the Contributor will inform Netlash. The latter will at its own discretion initiate action against the infringer, both in its own name and in the name of the relevant Contributors.
