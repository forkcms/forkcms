1. Make sure you have [composer](https://getcomposer.org/) installed.
2. Run `composer create-project forkcms/forkcms .` in your document root.
3. Browse to your website
4. Follow the steps on-screen

### Dependencies

**Remark**: If you are using GIT instead of composer create-project or the zip-file from [http://www.fork-cms.com](http://www.fork-cms.com), you
should install our dependencies. The dependencies are handled by [composer](http://getcomposer.org/)

To install the dependencies, you can run the command below in the document-root:

	composer install -o

If you're stuck or would like to discuss Fork CMS, talk to us on [slack](https://fork-cms.herokuapp.com/)!

## Running the tests

We use phpunit as a test framework. It's installed when using composer install.
To be able to run them, make sure you have a database with the same credentials as
your normal database and with the name suffixed with _test.

Because we support multiple php versions it gave some issues. Therefore we use the bridge from symfony.

Running the tests:

    composer test

Running only the unit, functional, or the installer tests

     composer test -- --testsuite=functional
     composer test -- --testsuite=unit
     composer test -- --testsuite=installer

If you want to run all the tests except the ones from the installer use

    composer test -- --exclude-group=installer

## Styling the backend

The backend uses [Bootstrap](http://www.getbootstrap.com) in combination with Sass. To make changes, you should make
the changes into the scss-files, and regenerate the real css with `gulp build`.

## Yarn

We use [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) to install our dependencies. For now we have a `gulp`-script that moves everything to
the correct directories. So if you change the dependencies, make sure you run `gulp build`.
